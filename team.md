### Lab Philosophy
- <em>I am not hiring as main supervisor until August 2025</em><br>
- <code>thomas.swinburne-at-cnrs.fr</code> for US opportunities
- Research projects balance applications with math/theory/methods depending on your interests- both are great.
- Current theory topics: post-Bayesian uncertainty quantification, data-driven coarse-graining, accelerated sampling of rare events
- Current applications: defect diffusion, aging in nuclear materials, irradiation damage, crystal plasticity and work-hardening
- My goal is to train and help you perform high-quality, boundary-pushing work, not to micromanage. 
- See below for past members and their current employment
