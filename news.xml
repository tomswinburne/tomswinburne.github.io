  <Header>New Mathematics For The Exascale, UCLA</Header>
  <Body>Tom will be in UCLA March-June, as a senior fellow in the long program "New mathematics for the exascale" at the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics. 
	Participation is still possible at some workshops, if this sounds interesting please get in touch!</Body>

  <Header>New paper in Acta Materialia</Header>
  <Body>A tour-de-force from postdoc of Petr Grigorev, funded by <![CDATA[<a href="#funding">ANR MeMoPas</a>]]>. 
  We use machine learning potentials as a highly flexible coupling medium, allowing world-first 
  large-scale atomistic simulations of defects and dislocations (i.e. real materials), where 
  the machine learning force field can be replaced by an embedded DFT simulation in any region of 
  interest. The first paper uses this to investigate impurity segregation to dislocations - a 
  small region around the impurity is treated with DFT, whilst the remainder by a state-of-the-art
  machine learning force-field. Many more exciting results from this project to come, as Petr
  will now be funded by a new grant from CEA, <![CDATA[<a href="#funding">PTC Emergence</a>]]>.

  <Header>New paper in Computational Materials Science</Header>
  <Body>From PhD of Reza Namakian. Using <![CDATA[<a href="#code">PAFI</a>]]>,
  the full stacking fault free energy profile is evaluated at finite temperature for the first time. Only metastable points
  have previously been evaluated; our full calculation gives the unstable 
  stacking fault (important for fracture) 
  and shows excellent agreement with molecular dynamics of isolated dislocations. 
  Reza is a student under Prof. Dorel Moldovan, Louisiana state university.</Body>

  <Header>PCCP paper "Capabilities and limits of autoencoders for extracting
		collective variables in atomistic materials science"</Header>
  <Body>Highlighted as 2022 "HOT" paper. Led by J. Baima and Marinica Group, CEA Saclay. 
	  Collective variables are an essential compenent of enhanced sampling approaches, but 
	  they can be very challenging to define. (See <![CDATA[<a href="#code">PAFI</a>]]>).
	This work investigates the ability of deep learning techniques to solve this problem.

  <Header>Petr's paper on ReproHack</Header>
  <Body>Reproducibility, the ability to reproduce reported results from underlying data, computer code and reported methodology, are essential for modern computational science. ReproHack is a new effort to demonstrate good practice in reproducible research, and Petr's paper is a great example! </Body>
