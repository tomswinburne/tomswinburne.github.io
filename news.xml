  <Body>
  To start 04/24, in collaboration with Sylvain Queyreau (LPSM, Paris Nord).
  DAPREDIS will develop data-driven techniques to accelerate and analyze
  simulations of dislocation plasticity at the atomic and mesoscale. The project will recrute a PhD student (Paris) and young postdoc (Marseille).

  <Header>New paper in Nature Communications</Header>
  <Body>
  From Marinica group, CEA Saclay. Compact Frank-Kasper nano-phases
  are previously missed 3D structures which significantly revise 
  our understanding of irradiation damage in materials. Our 
  <![CDATA[<a href="#code">TAMMBER</a>]]> code was used to rapidly 
  explore the complex energy landscape surrounding these clusters, 
  to establish their stability in realistic scenarios.

  <Body>
  With Wales group, U Cambridge. An in depth analysis of "Ill Conditioned" Markov Chains- stochastic discrete state models with transition 
  rates that vary massively from state-to-state- to such a degree that 
  standard analytical treatments fail. We show how these challenging 
  models can be simulated efficiently and stably via a novel state reduction 
  scheme that preserves first passage statistics between communities.

  <Header>New paper in Acta Materialia</Header>
  <Body>A tour-de-force from postdoc of Petr Grigorev, funded by <![CDATA[<a href="#funding">ANR MeMoPas</a>]]>. 
  We use machine learning potentials as a highly flexible coupling medium, allowing world-first 
  large-scale atomistic simulations of defects and dislocations (i.e. real materials), where 
  the machine learning force field can be replaced by an embedded DFT simulation in any region of 
  interest. The first paper uses this to investigate impurity segregation to dislocations - a 
  small region around the impurity is treated with DFT, whilst the remainder by a state-of-the-art
  machine learning force-field. Many more exciting results from this project to come, as Petr
  will now be funded by a new grant from CEA, <![CDATA[<a href="#funding">PTC Emergence</a>]]>.

  <Header>New paper in Computational Materials Science</Header>
  <Body>From PhD of Reza Namakian. Using <![CDATA[<a href="#code">PAFI</a>]]>,
  the full stacking fault free energy profile is evaluated at finite temperature for the first time. Only metastable points
  have previously been evaluated; our full calculation gives the unstable 
  stacking fault (important for fracture) 
  and shows excellent agreement with molecular dynamics of isolated dislocations. 
  Reza is a student under Prof. Dorel Moldovan, Louisiana state university.</Body>

  <Body>Highlighted as 2022 "HOT" paper. Led by J. Baima and Marinica Group, CEA Saclay. 
	  Collective variables are an essential compenent of enhanced sampling approaches, but 
	  they can be very challenging to define. (See <![CDATA[<a href="#code">PAFI</a>]]>).
	This work investigates the ability of deep learning techniques to solve this problem.
